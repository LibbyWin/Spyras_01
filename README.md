This project is based on a real life medical company based in London, known as Spyras. This company uses a paper device to monitor our breathing pattern in order to help prevent life threatening disease’s such as sepsis and potentially used for future benefits within the sporting industry to help record our rate of breathing.  

FUTURE ADD ONS 
 
Within the near future, I hope to add on multiple new features to the website which includes a section for my clients Awards and Sponsors, a recruitment section, merchandise store to buy the product and payment/booking systems.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML – Main language used to create and structure the website
CSS – the styling language used to create the aesthetics
Bootstrap frameworks – core structuring to build the grid layout to the website using a mobile first approach design.
GitHub – installed on all desktops in order to deploy the website and repositories of previous versions 
Google chrome developer tool – this was used a lot to make sure the webpage run smoothly on all devices. 

DEPLOYMENT

USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN
My goal with this project was to make an easy and simple webpage to access Spyras’ medial information while using a minimalist design. The use of black as a background helps the logos stand out more so than on a white background making the logos more distinctive, creating a memorable modern design.

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale colour scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.

Testing

There was regular testing throughout this project as it is required from a design perspective to visually see the creation. With the help of the Chrome Developer Tool it was a lot easier to see what was directly effecting elements. When i encountered an error, i first re read my code to make sure i havent mis typed or missed out a particular function. After, i would turn to the Chrome Developer Tool to see if i had anything overriding my specific element. in the event that the error couldnt be fixed through these two actions, I would turn my attention to Slack and code intitute tutors for guidance in finding the error and advice for tackling the error.
In the ‘About’ section, views can see what Spyras have created and how we can use the device for medical, sports and consumer purposes. If they are viewing on a mobile device, the image within the ‘about’ section will disappear due to it looking to cluttered, however the all other images will still be present. Everything will be aligned vertically, showing one piece of information at a time. On a desktop view, all the information can be seen horizontally except the ‘Creators’ section. This is due to aligning the importance of the team members.
Views are able to view all Spyras’ social media accounts by clicking on the icons within the footer. This will open within a new tab to allow the view to keep position on the original website. This was done by adding ‘target=”_blank”’. All links have been tested and work as intended.
This site has been tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing, I realised that the navigation bar seemed to be located behind my first image which needed altering by adding ‘z-index: 1;’ to the .navbar. 

DEPLOYMENT

This site is hosted on GitHub pages, deployed from the master branch. This site is automatically updates when there is a new commit, allowing for the website to be continuously updated. 
To run the site correctly, the home page must be named as ‘index.html’  and in order for the CSS file to be correctly directed to the 
home page, it must have the corrects names within the file system. 

WORK BASE ON OTHERS CODE

- During my learning of previous modules, the "Whiskey Drop" mini project was very benificail. Certain aspects from that site had been impicated into my own site and i did recap the lessons again to make sure i had correctly used the code. 
- Looking online, i found that W3School had web templates which i took inspiration from as a certain few are very minimal and matched my desired design.
- Throught out my project, i kept a close eye on the sample piece of work to make sure i was keeping on the correct path and to make sure my woek was up to a high standard.

Credits
- Thank you to my mentor, Brian Macharia, for helping me plan and excicute this project.
- To the Owner of Spryas, George Winfield, for allowing me to update his website and for the addition support with meetings, answering questions and multiple phone calls.
